Q) Assume you need to setup a LAN in Lab-2 of Department of CSE at BMSCE. Create a topology of 10 nodes and simulate sending a simple PDU from source to destination chosen by you using two hubs (each hub has 5 end PCs) and a switch connecting the hubs as connecting devices. After the simulation the IP address needs to get assigned. Use suitable protocol to achieve the same.
