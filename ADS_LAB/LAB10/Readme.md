Write a program to implement the following functions on a Binomial heap:
1.	delete(H): Like Binary Heap, delete operation first reduces the key to minus infinite, then calls extractMin().
2.	decreaseKey(H): decreaseKey() is also similar to Binary Heap. We compare the decreases key with it parent and if parentâ€™s key is more, we swap keys and recur for parent. We stop when we either reach a node whose parent has smaller key or we hit the root node.
